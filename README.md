Air pollution is a serious worldwide problem that affects ecosystems, human health,
and the environment. As pollutant levels rise, precise predicted solutions are needed.
The goal of this research is to create a machine learning framework that uses
atmospheric and pollutants data to forecast air quality levels. Several feature selection
methods, such as Forward Selection, Backward Selection, and Correlation Analysis,
were used to assess models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random
Forest, and SVM. When paired with forward selection, logistic regression had the
lowest mean squared error (0.0408) and the best accuracy (0.9785), consistently
outperforming other models. Appropriate model assessment was ensured by using
metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy, and MSE to guide the evaluation procedure.
The final Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well on real-world
datasets after being optimized with Forward Selection features.
